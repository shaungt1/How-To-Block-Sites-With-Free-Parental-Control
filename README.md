How To Block Websites With Free Parental Control 


<hr/>

First of all I just want to state a disclaimer this solution  is in no way promoting not using videogames or blocking kids from their outlets to have fun. I love technology and video games to. Today we see kids overly distracted because there is too much temptation and distraction.

This solution is for frustrated parents who are working their butts off and have kids on youtube all day or playing fortnite, Roblox, Minecraft, Xbox,PS4, Nintendo, Discord, etc.. all day long. While thier parents are not around instead of doing their school work. 

This is for kids who are in effect locked down at home school due to COVID and failing thier homeschool classes. 

As a parent I know firsthand that given wide open internet access to a kid or a teenager it's just way too much Temptation and responsibility for some kids to handle. 

This is why I decided to make this video. To help struggling parents out, and to help kids focus with less distractions get through thier school with less as many  distractions as possible.
